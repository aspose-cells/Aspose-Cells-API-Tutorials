In this tutorial, we will guide you step by step to explain the below C# source code which can get an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET using its name. We will include sample code for each step to help you understand the process in detail.

## Step 1: Define the Document Directory

To start, you need to set the directory path where your Excel file is located. Replace "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY" in the code with the actual path of your Excel file.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Set Excel File Input Path

Next, you need to set the input path of the Excel file you want to open. This path will be used to create a file stream.

```csharp
// Excel file input path
string InputPath = dataDir + "book1.xlsx";
```

## Step 3: Create a File Stream and Open the Excel File

Next, you need to create a file stream and open the Excel file using the `FileStream` class.

```csharp
// Create a file stream containing the Excel file to open
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(InputPath, FileMode.Open);
```

## Step 4: Instantiate a Workbook Object

After opening the Excel file, you need to instantiate a `Workbook` object. This object represents the Excel workbook and offers various methods and properties to manipulate the workbook.

```csharp
// Instantiate a Workbook object
// Open the Excel file via the file flow
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);
```

## Step 5: Access a Worksheet by Name

To access a specific worksheet by name, you can use the `Worksheets` property of the `Workbook` object and index the worksheet name.

```csharp
// Access a worksheet using its sheet name
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets["Sheet1"];
```

## Step 6: Access a specific Cell

Once you have navigated to the desired worksheet, you can navigate to a specific cell using the `Cells` property of the `Worksheet` object and index the cell reference.

```csharp
// Access to a specific cell
Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
```

## Step 7: Retrieve Cell Value

Finally, you can retrieve the cell value using the `Value` property of the `Cell` object.

```csharp
// Retrieve the cell value
Console.WriteLine(cell.Value);
```
