In this tutorial, we will take you step by step to explain the C# source code below which is to delete an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. We will include sample code for each step to help you understand the process in detail.

## Step 1: Define the Document Directory

To start, you need to set the directory path where your Excel file is located. Replace "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY" in the code with the actual path of your Excel file.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Create a File Stream and Open the Excel File

Next, you need to create a file stream and open the Excel file using the `FileStream` class.

```csharp
// Create a file stream containing the Excel file to open
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(dataDir + "book1.xls", FileMode.Open);
```

## Step 3: Instantiate a Workbook Object

After opening the Excel file, you need to instantiate a `Workbook` object. This object represents the Excel workbook and offers various methods and properties to manipulate the workbook.

```csharp
// Instantiate a Workbook object
// Open the Excel file via the file flow
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);
```

## Step 4: Delete a Worksheet by Index

To remove a worksheet from its index, you can use the `RemoveAt()` method of the `Worksheets` object of the `Workbook` object. The index of the worksheet you want to delete must be passed as a parameter.

```csharp
// Delete a worksheet using its sheet index
workbook.Worksheets.RemoveAt(0);
```

## Step 5: Save the Workbook

Once you have deleted the worksheet, you can save the modified Excel workbook using the `Save()` method of the `Workbook` object.

```csharp
// Save the Excel workbook
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.out.xls");
```
