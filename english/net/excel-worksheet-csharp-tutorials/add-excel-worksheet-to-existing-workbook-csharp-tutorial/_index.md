In this tutorial, we will take you step by step to explain the C# source code below, which helps to add a new sheet to an existing Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET. We will include sample code for each step to help you understand the process in detail.

## Step 1: Define the Document Directory

To start, you need to set the directory path where your Excel file is located. Replace "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY" in the code with the actual path of your Excel file.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Create a File Stream and Open the Excel File

Next, you need to create a file stream and open the Excel file using the `FileStream` class.

```csharp
// Create a file stream containing the Excel file to open
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(dataDir + "book1.xls", FileMode.Open);
```

## Step 3: Instantiate a Workbook Object

After opening the Excel file, you need to instantiate a `Workbook` object. This object represents the Excel workbook and offers various methods and properties to manipulate the workbook.

```csharp
// Instantiate a Workbook object
// Open the Excel file via the file flow
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);
```

## Step 4: Add a New Sheet to the Workbook

To add a new worksheet to the workbook, you can use the `Worksheets.Add()` method of the `Workbook` object. This method returns the index of the newly added sheet.

```csharp
// Add a new sheet to the Workbook workbook
int i = workbook. Worksheets. Add();
```

## Step 5: Set New Sheet Name

You can set the name of the newly added sheet using the `Name` property of the `Worksheet` object.

```csharp
// Obtain the reference of the new sheet added by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];
// Define the name of the new sheet
worksheet.Name = "My Worksheet";
```

## Step 6: Save the Excel File

Once you have added the new sheet and set its name, you can save the modified Excel file using the `Save()` method of the `Workbook` object.

```csharp
// Save the Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.out.xls");
```

## Step 7: Close File Stream and Release Resources

Finally, it is important to close the file stream to release all the resources associated with it.

```csharp
// Close file stream to release all resources
fstream.Close();
```

// Instantiating a Workbook object
// Opening the Excel file through the file stream
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);
// Adding a new worksheet to the Workbook object
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();
// Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];
// Setting the name of the newly added worksheet
worksheet.Name = "My Worksheet";
// Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.out.xls");
// Closing the file stream to free all resources
fstream.Close();
```
