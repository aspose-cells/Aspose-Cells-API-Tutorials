In this tutorial, we will explain step by step C# source code to add a new sheet in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Adding a new worksheet to an Excel workbook is a common operation when creating reports or manipulating data. Aspose.Cells is a powerful library that makes it easy to manipulate and generate Excel files using .NET. Follow the steps below to understand and implement this code.

## Step 1: Document Directory Setup

The first step is to define the document directory where the Excel file will be saved. If the directory does not exist, we create it using the following code:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
// Create the directory if it doesn't already exist.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```

Be sure to replace "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY" with the appropriate path to your documents directory.

## Step 2: Instantiating a Workbook Object

The second step is to instantiate a Workbook object, which represents the Excel workbook. Use the following code:

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

This object will be used to add a new worksheet and perform other operations on the Excel workbook.

## Step 3: Adding a new worksheet

The third step is to add a new worksheet to the Workbook object. Use the following code:

```csharp
int index = workbook. Worksheets. Add();
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[index];
```

This will add a new worksheet to the Workbook object and you will get a reference to this worksheet using its index.

## Step 4: Setting the name of the new worksheet

The fourth step is to give the new worksheet a name. You can use the following code to set the worksheet name:

```csharp
worksheet.Name = "My Worksheet";
```

Replace "My Spreadsheet" with the desired name for the new sheet.

## Step 5: Saving the Excel file

Finally, the last step is to save the Excel file. Use the following code:

```csharp
string filePath = dataDir + "output.out.xls";
workbook.Save(filePath);
```

This will save the Excel workbook with the new worksheet to the documents directory you specified.

// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
// Adding a new worksheet to the Workbook object
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();
// Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];
// Setting the name of the newly added worksheet
worksheet.Name = "My Worksheet";
// Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.out.xls");
```
