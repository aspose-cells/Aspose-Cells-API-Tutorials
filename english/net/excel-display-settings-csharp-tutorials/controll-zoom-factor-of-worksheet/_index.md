Controlling the zoom factor of a worksheet is an essential feature when working with Excel files using the Aspose.Cells library for .NET. In this guide, we will show you how to use Aspose.Cells to control the zoom factor of a worksheet using C# source code step by step.

## Step 1: Import required libraries

Before you start, make sure you have installed the Aspose.Cells library for .NET and import the necessary libraries into your C# project.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```

## Step 2: Set Directory Path and Open Excel File

To start, set the path to the directory containing your Excel file, then open it using a `FileStream` object and instantiate a `Workbook` object to represent the Excel workbook.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(dataDir + "book1.xls", FileMode.Open);
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);
```

## Step 3: Access the spreadsheet and change the zoom factor

In this step, we access the first worksheet of the Excel workbook using index `0` and set the worksheet zoom factor to `75`.

```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
worksheet. Zoom = 75;
```

## Step 4: Save changes and close the file

Once we change the worksheet zoom factor, we save the changes to the Excel file using the `Save` method of the `Workbook` object. Then we close the file stream to release all used resources.

```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
fstream.Close();
```

### Sample source code for Controll Zoom Factor Of Worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET 

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
// Creating a file stream containing the Excel file to be opened
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(dataDir + "book1.xls", FileMode.Open);
// Instantiating a Workbook object
// Opening the Excel file through the file stream
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);
// Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
// Setting the zoom factor of the worksheet to 75
worksheet.Zoom = 75;
// Saving the modified Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
// Closing the file stream to free all resources
fstream.Close();
```
