Protecting an Excel spreadsheet is often used to restrict access to and modification of data. In this tutorial, we will guide you step by step to understand and implement the provided C# source code to unlock a protected Excel spreadsheet using the Aspose.Cells library for .NET.

## Step 1: Preparing the environment

Before you start, make sure you have Aspose.Cells for .NET installed on your machine. You can download the library from the official website of Aspose and install it by following the instructions provided.

Once the installation is complete, create a new C# project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) and import the Aspose.Cells library for .NET.

## Step 2: Configuring the document directory path

In the provided source code, you need to specify the directory path where the Excel file you want to unlock is located. Modify the `dataDir` variable by replacing "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY" with the absolute path of the directory on your machine.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "PATH TO YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 3: Creating a Workbook Object

To start, we need to create a Workbook object that represents our Excel file. Use the Workbook class constructor and specify the full path of the Excel file to open.

```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "book1.xls");
```

## Step 4: Accessing the spreadsheet

Next, we need to navigate to the first worksheet in the Excel file. Use the `Worksheets` property of the Workbook object to access the collection of worksheets, then use the `[0]` index to access the first sheet.

```csharp
// Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

## Step 5: Unlocking the Spreadsheet

Now we will unlock the worksheet using the `Unprotect()` method of the Worksheet object. Leave the password string blank (`""`) if the spreadsheet is not password protected.

```csharp
// Unprotecting the worksheet with a password
worksheet.Unprotect("");
```

## Step 6: Saving the unlocked Excel file

Once the spreadsheet is unlocked, we can save the final Excel file. Use the `Save()` method to specify the full path of the output file.

```csharp
// Save Workbook


workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.out.xls");
```

### Sample source code for Unlock Protected Excel Sheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET

try
{
    // The path to the documents directory.
    string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
    // Instantiating a Workbook object

    // Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file
    Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
    // Unprotecting the worksheet with a password
    worksheet.Unprotect("");
    // Save Workbook
    workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.out.xls");
}
catch(Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    Console.ReadLine();
}
```
