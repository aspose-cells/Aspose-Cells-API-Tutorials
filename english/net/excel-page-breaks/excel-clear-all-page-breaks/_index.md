Removing page breaks in an Excel file is an essential step when handling reports or spreadsheets. In this tutorial, we will guide you step by step to understand and implement the provided C# source code to remove all page breaks in an Excel file using Aspose.Cells library for .NET.

## Step 1: Preparing the environment

Before you start, make sure you have Aspose.Cells for .NET installed on your machine. You can download the library from the [Aspose Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net) and install it by following the instructions provided.

Once the installation is complete, create a new C# project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) and import the Aspose.Cells library for .NET.

## Step 2: Configuring the document directory path

In the provided source code, you need to specify the directory path where you want to save the generated Excel file. Modify the `dataDir` variable by replacing "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY" with the absolute path of the directory on your machine.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "PATH TO YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 3: Creating a Workbook Object

To start, we need to create a Workbook object that represents our Excel file. This can be achieved using the Workbook class provided by Aspose.Cells.

```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

## Step 4: Remove page breaks

Now we are going to remove all page breaks in our Excel worksheet. In the sample code, we use the `Clear()` methods for the horizontal and vertical page breaks to remove them all.

```csharp
workbook.Worksheets[0].HorizontalPageBreaks.Clear();
workbook.Worksheets[0].VerticalPageBreaks.Clear();
```

## Step 5: Saving the Excel file

Once all page breaks have been removed, we can save the final Excel file. Use the `Save()` method to specify the full path of the output file.

```csharp
// Save the Excel file.
workbook.Save(dataDir + "ClearingPageBreaks_out.xls");
```
