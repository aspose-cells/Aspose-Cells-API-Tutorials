In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps to set advanced protection settings for an Excel spreadsheet using the Aspose.Cells library for .NET. Follow the instructions below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Preparation

Make sure you have installed Aspose.Cells for .NET and created a C# project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE).

## Step 2: Set the document directory path

Declare a `dataDir` variable and initialize it with the path to your documents directory. For example :

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DIRECTORY_OF_DOCUMENTS";
```

Be sure to replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENTS_DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your directory.

## Step 3: Create a file stream to open the Excel file

Create a `FileStream` object containing the Excel file to open:

```csharp
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(dataDir + "book1.xls", FileMode.Open);
```

Make sure you have the Excel file `book1.xls` in your documents directory or specify the correct file name and location.

## Step 4: Instantiate a Workbook object and open the Excel file

Use the `Workbook` class from Aspose.Cells to instantiate a Workbook object and open the specified Excel file via the file stream:

```csharp
Workbook excel = new Workbook(fstream);
```

## Step 5: Access the first worksheet

Navigate to the first worksheet of the Excel file:

```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = excel.Worksheets[0];
```

## Step 6: Set Worksheet Protection Settings

Use Worksheet object properties to set worksheet protection settings as needed. For example :

```csharp
worksheet.Protection.AllowDeletingColumn = false;
worksheet.Protection.AllowDeletingRow = false;
worksheet.Protection.AllowEditingContent = false;
worksheet.Protection.AllowEditingObject = false;
// ... Set other protection settings as needed...
```

## Step 7: Save the modified Excel file

Save the modified Excel file using the `Save` method of the Workbook object:

```csharp
excel.Save(dataDir + "output.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
```

Be sure to specify the desired path and filename for the output file.

## Step 8: Close the file stream

Once saved, close the file stream to release all associated resources:

```csharp
fstream.Close();
```

worksheet.Protection.AllowSelectingLockedCell = true;
// Allowing users to select unlocked cells of the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowSelectingUnlockedCell = true;
// Allowing users to sort
worksheet.Protection.AllowSorting = true;
// Allowing users to use pivot tables in the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowUsingPivotTable = true;
// Saving the modified Excel file
excel.Save(dataDir + "output.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
// Closing the file stream to free all resources
fstream.Close();
