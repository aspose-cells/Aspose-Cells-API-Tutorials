In this guide, we will walk you through how to set print titles in an Excel spreadsheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Follow the steps below to accomplish this task.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Make sure you have set up your development environment and installed Aspose.Cells for .NET. You can download the latest version of the library from Aspose official website.

## Step 2: Import required namespaces

In your C# project, import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.Cells:

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
```

## Step 3: Setting the path to the documents directory

Declare a `dataDir` variable to specify the path to the directory where you want to save the generated Excel file:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DIRECTORY_OF_DOCUMENTS";
```

Be sure to replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with the correct path on your system.

## Step 4: Creating a Workbook Object

Instantiate a Workbook object that represents the Excel workbook you want to create:

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

## Step 5: Access to the first worksheet

Navigate to the first worksheet in the Excel workbook using the following code:

```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

## Step 6: Defining Title Columns

Define the title columns using the following code:

```csharp
pageSetup.PrintTitleColumns = "$A:$B";
```

Here we have defined columns A and B as title columns. You can adjust this value according to your needs.

## Step 7: Defining Title Lines

Define the title lines using the following code:

```csharp
pageSetup.PrintTitleRows = "$1:$2";
```

We have defined rows 1 and 2 as title rows. You can adjust these values according to your needs.

## Step 8: Saving the Excel workbook

To save the Excel workbook with the print titles defined, use the `Save` method of the Workbook object:

```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "SetPrintTitle_out.xls");
```

This will save the Excel workbook with file name "SetPrintTitle_out.xls" in the specified directory.
