Adding page breaks in an Excel file is an essential feature when creating large reports or documents. In this tutorial, we will explore how to add page breaks in an Excel file using the Aspose.Cells library for .NET. We will guide you step by step to understand and implement the provided C# source code.

## Step 1: Preparing the environment

Before you start, make sure you have Aspose.Cells for .NET installed on your machine. You can download the library from the [Aspose Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net) and install it by following the instructions provided.

Once the installation is complete, create a new C# project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) and import the Aspose.Cells library for .NET.

## Step 2: Configuring the document directory path

In the provided source code, you need to specify the directory path where you want to save the generated Excel file. Modify the `dataDir` variable by replacing "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY" with the absolute path of the directory on your machine.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "PATH TO YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 3: Creating a Workbook Object

To start, we need to create a Workbook object that represents our Excel file. This can be achieved using the Workbook class provided by Aspose.Cells.

```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

## Step 4: Adding a horizontal page break

Now let's add a horizontal page break to our Excel worksheet. In the sample code, we add a horizontal page break to cell "Y30" of the first worksheet.

```csharp
workbook.Worksheets[0].HorizontalPageBreaks.Add("Y30");
```

## Step 5: Adding a vertical page break

Similarly, we can add a vertical page break using the `VerticalPageBreaks.Add()` method. In our example, we are adding a vertical page break to cell "Y30" of the first worksheet.

```csharp
workbook.Worksheets[0].VerticalPageBreaks.Add("Y30");
```

## Step 6: Saving the Excel file

Now that we've added the page breaks, we need to save the final Excel file. Use the `Save()` method to specify the full path of the output file.

```csharp
// Save the Excel file.
workbook.Save(dataDir + "AddingPageBreaks_out.xls");
```
